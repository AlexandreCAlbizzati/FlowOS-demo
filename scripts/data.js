\nWhat we have here is basically the menu, taskbar buttons and windows behaviour implemented, including the windows' state and the needed events wired up, using vanilla JS.\
\n\nOne can have access to a few items like the following (for testing the windows' behaviour): \
\n\t Start > Internet Explorer \
\n\t Start > Command Prompt \
\n\t Start > All Programs > Accessories > Notepad\
\n\nCheers,\nAlex",
